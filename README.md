# Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and many other applications.

## Features

- Clear and concise syntax that emphasizes readability and ease of use.
- Large and active community of developers.
- Vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools.
- Open-source language with freely available source code.

## Usage

To use Python, you need to install it on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have installed Python, you can run Python scripts using the Python interpreter, which is included in the Python installation. You can also use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and run Python code.

# SimPy

SimPy is a process-based discrete-event simulation framework that is written in Python. It allows you to model and simulate complex systems, such as manufacturing plants, transportation networks, and healthcare facilities.

## Features

- Process-based simulation with a simple and intuitive syntax.
- Supports various event types, including timeouts, events triggered by other processes, and events triggered by resources becoming available.
- Built-in support for statistical analysis of simulation results.
- Comprehensive documentation and a large and active community of developers.

## Usage

To use SimPy, you need to install it on your computer. You can install SimPy using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

<!-- pip install simpy -->
<div class="copy">
  <span id="text-to-copy">This text can be copied</span>
  <button onclick="copyToClipboard()">Copy</button>
</div>

<script>
  function copyToClipboard() {
    var text = document.getElementById("text-to-copy").innerText;
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(text);
  }
</script>

Once you have installed SimPy, you can create a simulation by defining the processes and resources involved, specifying their behavior, and running the simulation using the SimPy environment.
